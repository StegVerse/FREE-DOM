# FREE-DOM: Factually Recounting Epstein’s Era – Deconstruction of Morality

**FREE-DOM** is an open-source factual archive reconstructing the verified
timeline, documents, and organizational ecosystem of the Epstein era (1990–2025).

Each dataset is compiled exclusively from verifiable public records:
- Court filings and unsealed SDNY documents  
- U.S. congressional releases and hearings  
- Verified nonprofit filings and corporate registrations  
- Photo/video evidence published by recognized outlets  

No speculation or unverified claims appear in this repository.
The purpose is documentation and analysis of systemic moral collapse
across legal, political, and cultural institutions.
