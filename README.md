## ⚙️ Workflows Overview

- **AI Search Agent** – performs daily public-source sweeps (RSS/news only) and appends leads to records.  
- **Auto Update** – merges pending data into master, updates [CHECKLIST.md](CHECKLIST.md) and [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md), and validates schema.  
- **Validation Layer** – ensures CSV consistency and master integrity.

## 🧠 Purpose

FREE-DOM exists to preserve factual record-keeping while empowering creative, educational, and investigative work **without directly naming real individuals** in narrative form.  
It keeps transparency high, maintains auditability, and prevents misinformation.
