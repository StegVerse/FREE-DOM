## ⚙️ Contribution Workflow

1. **Fork** the repository and create a new branch:  
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-branch-name
   ```

2. **Add or modify data** in the correct subdirectory:
   - `data/pending/` — new or partially verified submissions  
   - `data/unverified/` — leads needing confirmation  
   - `data/master/` — (CI-managed) fully verified datasets

3. **Run local checks** (optional but recommended):
   ```bash
   python scripts/build_checklist.py
   python scripts/build_changelog.py
   python scripts/update_timeline.py
   ```

4. **Commit and push** your changes:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Add: new verified entries"
   git push origin feature/your-branch-name
   ```

5. **Open a Pull Request** and include:
   - Source reliability
   - Verification stage (pending / confirmed)
   - Notes on any leads or anomalies

  3) **Integrate** only anonymized, non-identifying details that meet our policies.
